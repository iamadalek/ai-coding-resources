# Issue Writer Skill

Write requirements-focused issues/tickets that describe **what** needs to be done, not **how** to implement it. Works with any tracker: GitHub, Linear, Jira, Asana, etc.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new issue or ticket
- Updating an existing issue's requirements
- Planning work that will become an issue

## Issue Structure

### Required Sections

```markdown
## Overview
[1-2 sentences describing the problem or need]

## Problem
[What's wrong or missing? Why does this matter?]

## Requirements
[What must the solution accomplish? Describe behaviors, not code.]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]

## Constraints
[What limitations must the implementation respect?]

## Dependencies
[What other work must complete first? Link to issues.]

## Reference
[Links to docs, prior issues, or relevant context]
```

### Optional Sections

- **Research Notes**: Prior research, architectural decisions, or context from closed issues. Link to sources rather than duplicating content.
- **Non-Goals**: Explicitly out of scope
- **Open Questions**: Decisions needed before implementation
- **Security Considerations**: If relevant

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Never include in issues:**

1. **Code blocks with implementation**
   - ❌ `class UserModel < ApplicationRecord`
   - ❌ `def process_data(input)`
   - ✅ "The system should validate user input"

2. **Specific class/method/file names**
   - ❌ "Add method `calculate_score` to `ScoreService`"
   - ✅ "Provide a way to calculate user scores"

3. **Numeric estimates**
   - ❌ "This should take 4-6 hours"
   - ❌ "Requires ~15 test files"
   - ✅ "Should have comprehensive test coverage"

4. **Implementation phases**
   - ❌ "Phase 1: Create models, Phase 2: Add API"
   - ✅ Describe the end-state requirements

5. **Hardcoded thresholds**
   - ❌ "Set timeout to 30 seconds"
   - ✅ "Timeout should be configurable"

## Why This Matters

- **Separation of concerns**: Requirements define "what", implementation defines "how"
- **Flexibility**: Implementer can research and choose the best approach
- **Longevity**: Requirements stay valid even if implementation changes
- **Clarity**: Reviewers can verify requirements are met without understanding implementation

## Validation Checklist

Before creating an issue, verify:

- [ ] No code blocks showing implementation
- [ ] No specific class/method/file names
- [ ] No time or effort estimates
- [ ] No implementation phases or steps
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are behavior-focused
- [ ] Could be implemented in any language/framework

## Examples

### ❌ Bad Issue

```markdown
## Add User Authentication

Create `AuthService` class with `login(email, password)` method.
Use bcrypt for password hashing. Add migration for users table
with email, password_digest columns. Estimated: 4 hours.

Phase 1: Models (2 hours)
Phase 2: Controllers (1.5 hours)
Phase 3: Tests (0.5 hours)
```

### ✅ Good Issue

```markdown
## Overview
Users need to authenticate to access protected features.

## Problem
Currently all features are publicly accessible. We need to
restrict certain actions to logged-in users.

## Requirements
- Users can create accounts with email and password
- Users can log in with valid credentials
- Invalid credentials are rejected with clear feedback
- Sessions persist across browser restarts
- Password storage follows security best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New users can register
- [ ] Existing users can log in
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login
- [ ] Passwords are never stored in plaintext

## Constraints
- Must work with existing user data if any
- Should not require third-party auth services

## Reference
- OWASP Authentication Guidelines
```
